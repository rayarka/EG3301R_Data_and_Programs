# Purpose

In this directory, there are 3 JSON files which contain the positional coordinates of various objects that can be used to simulate the effect of reflectors on a solar panel. ***The interpretation is described in detail in the report.*** Here, I will state how to view these files as intended.

*Note: These simulations are not intended to provide any quantitative results, such as % increase of irradiance or optimal angles. They are merely used to check the parameters and values we have derived.*

1. Open https://ricktu288.github.io/ray-optics/simulator/. This is a github repo which is hosted as a web app, created by another user. Here we can create different types of lens and mirror simulations. The github repo itself is available at https://github.com/ricktu288/ray-optics 
2. On the top row of options, press `Open` (See Image 1)
3. Load the JSON file you wish to see in greater detail (the interpretation of the visualisation is discussed in the report).
4. You can adjust settings on the webapp itself. Rememer to `Reset` to return to a blank screen. (See Image 1)

# Visualisations
The 3 provided JSON files will provide you with the following images:

Use the other controls available in the application to explore them further.
